event-type can be: add-define, un-define, use-define, add-header
entity-type can be: object, function, header
entity-name will have quotes or <> brackets around it, depending upon whether it is a local or system header
"further-expansions" are the expansions of the macro, if the event-type is use-define or add-define. macros which call other macros will have more than one; simple macros will have just one. */
